Overview:

SoundCloud is an audio platform that enables anyone to upload, record, promote and 
share their originally-created sounds across the internet, in a simple, accessible 
and feature-rich way. From sample to symphony and soundbite to soliloquy, SoundCloud 
allows sound creators anywhere to instantly record audio on the site or via mobile 
applications and share them publicly or privately; to embed sound across websites, 
social networks and blogs and receive feedback from the community.

SoundCloud's open platform also supports a wide range of applications built on the 
SoundCloud API, enabling everything from mobile voice recording, online mastering, 
digital distribution to Facebook artist profiles and iPad music making. SoundCloud 
offers free accounts to amateur creators, with more advanced users able to upgrade 
to premium accounts for advanced features like statistics, controlled distribution 
and custom branding.

This repository plugin uses the PHP SoundCloud API wrapper developed by Anton Lindqvist
